Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is systematic application of engineering principles, method and tools to build solutions and development and maintenace of hig quality software that would solve problems through technology. It is important in the technology industrt because it provides solutions to real life problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming language eg fortran and the C languages
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: this involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: this involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: this involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: this involves provision of ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 
 The Waterfall method involves sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile methodology invlves Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. The Agile methodology prioritize collaboration, continous delivey and customer feedback.

 waterfall methodology would be appropraite when requirements are clear and fixed and may not change, risk is zero or minimum.
 Agile methodology would be appropraite when new changes need to be implemented.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
