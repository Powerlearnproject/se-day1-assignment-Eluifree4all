#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is systematic application of engineering principles, method and tools to build solutions and development and maintenace of hig quality software that would solve problems through technology. It is important in the technology industrt because it provides solutions to real life problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. development of programming language eg fortran and the C languages
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: this involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: this involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: this involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: this involves provision of ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 
 The Waterfall method involves sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile methodology invlves Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. The Agile methodology prioritize collaboration, continous delivey and customer feedback.

 waterfall methodology would be appropraite when requirements are clear and fixed and may not change, risk is zero or minimum.
 Agile methodology would be appropraite when new changes need to be implemented.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
The Quality Assurance Engineer is the one who ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
The Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are Software suites that provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA

Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples are Git and Subversion).



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges faced by software engineers are 
1. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
2. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing is the testing of the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing is the testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
 It is very important because it helps in giving clear instructions to a very smart assistant or AI model


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Asking an AI , tell me about a car is a vague prompt, we can make it more concise and clear by saying Tell me about the Toyota Corolla 2015. The later prompt is more clear and specific
